<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>
  The <a href="https://checkerframework.org/">Checker Framework</a> is an
  innovative programming tool that helps you prevent bugs at development
  time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of
  <em>pluggable type-checking</em>.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a
  programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful,
  expressive one.
</p>

<p>
  Java's type system prevents some bugs, such as <code>int count =
  "hello";</code>.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null
  pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private
  information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, and
  so forth.  We have created around 20
  <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction">new type
  systems</a>, and other people have created
  <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers">many
  more</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and
  use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a
  bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that
  no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is
  powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules
  that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.
</p>

<p>
  The Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of
  projects at Google, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to
  small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and
  the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for
  Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple
  awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there
  is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug
  fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.  We welcome
  your contribution!
</p>

<p>
  Why should you join this project?  It's popular, so you will have an
  impact.  It makes code more robust and secure, which is a socially
  important purpose.  Past GSOC students have had great success, such as
  one (David Lazar) who became a graduate student at MIT; other students on
  the project have published papers in scientific conferences.  You will
  get to scratch your own itch by creating tools that solve problems that
  frustrate you.  And, we have a lot of fun on this project!
</p>

<p>
  <b>Prerequisites:</b> You should be very comfortable with the Java
  programming language and its type system.  You should know how a type
  system helps you and where it can hinder you.  You should be willing to
  dive into and understand a moderately-sized codebase.  It is extremely
  helpful if you understand fundamental object-oriented programming concepts.
  One example is
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">behavioral
  subtyping</a>:  subtyping theory
  permits arguments to change contravariantly (even though Java forbids it
  for reasons related to overloading), whereas return values may change
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_%28computer_science%29">covariantly</a>
  both in theory and in Java.
</p>


<p>
<b>Potential projects:</b>
Most of this document lists potential summer projects.  The projects are grouped roughly
from easiest to most challenging.
<!--
You can find more potential projects in the
<a href="https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/issues">issue
  tracker</a>.
-->
</p>



<h2 id="get-started">How to get started</h2>

<p>
  To <b>get started</b>, do a case study of using the Checker Framework.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#installation">Install</a>
    the Checker Framework.
  <li>
    Choose a program to type-check.  This should be an already-existing
    program.  It should not be newly-written code, nor a set of tiny
    benchmarks that aim to expose corner cases.  (Corner cases are great to
    discover, but only if they come up in real code.)
    <br/>
    You will find the case study easier if you are already familiar with
    the program.  Choose a program that is
    relatively small, or choose a small part of a larger program.
    <!-- Choose a program that the checker has never been run on in the past. -->
    A program that you have written, such as for your coursework, is a good
    first choice.
  <li>
    Choose one type system, from among those distributed with the Checker
    Framework, that is appropriate for the program.
  <li>
    Annotate the program and run the type-checker, until the type-checker
    passes on the program.  This might require adding more annotations,
    fixing bugs in the program, or suppressing warnings.
  <li>
    Share it with us so that
    we can evaluate it and give you feedback.  Share the case study as soon
    as you finish it; don't wait until you submit your proposal.
    You should give us access to
    <ul>
      <li>the original (unannotated) version of the program,
      <li>and the annotated version of the program, and
      <li>the exact command that runs the type-checker from the command
        line.
    </ul>
</ol>

<p>
The primary result of your case study is that
you will discover bugs in the subject program, or
you will verify that it has no bugs (of some particular type).  If you
found bugs, report them to the program's maintainer, and let us know when
they are resolved.  If you verified the program to be correct, that is
great too; let us know and point us at the fully-annotated, verified program.
</p>

<p>
Another outcome of your case study is that you may discover bugs, limitations,
or usability problems in the Checker Framework.  Please
<a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#reporting-bugs">report them</a>.
We'll try to fix them, or they might give you inspiration for
improvements you would like to make to the Checker Framework this summer.
You can also try to fix them yourself and submit a
<a href="https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/pulls">pull
  request</a>, but that is not a requirement.
Please discuss your ideas with us by sending mail
to checker-framework-gsoc@googlegroups.com.
</p>

<p>
  Note that we do not recommend that you run many different checkers on
  small, artificial programs.  Instead, run one checker on a more
  substantial program.
  </p>

<p>
Why should you start with a case study, instead of diving right into fixing
bugs, designing a new type system, or making other changes to the Checker
Framework?
Before you can contribute to any project, you must
understand the tool from a user point of view, including its strengths,
weaknesses, and how to use it.  Therefore, you need to complete your case
study first.
</p>


<h2 id="ask-questions">How to get help and ask questions</h2>

<p>
We are very happy to answer your questions, and we are eager to interact
with you.  However, don't send us a message
that says nothing but &ldquo;please guide me&rdquo;
or &ldquo;tell me how to fix this bug&rdquo;.  Such a message shows
that you haven't thought about the problem and haven't tried to solve it
yourself.  Instead, show that you will be a productive colleague over the
summer:  tell us what you have tried, tell us what went wrong or
where you got stuck, and ask a concrete technical question that will
help you get past your problem.  (If you can do that, then definitely ask
your question, because we don't want you to be stuck or frustrated.)  Be
sure you have read and followed these &ldquo;getting started&rdquo;
instructions, and that you have looked in the
<a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/">Checker Framework manual</a>
for the answer before asking.  Don't try to start fixing issues before you
understand the Checker Framework from the user point of view, which will
not happen until you have completed your initial case study.
</p>

<p>
Whenever you send email (related to GSoC or not),
please use standard email etiquette, such as:  avoid all-caps; use a
descriptive subject line; don't put multiple different topics in a single
email message; start a new thread with a new subject line
when you change the topic; don't clutter discussions with irrelevant
remarks or unsubstantiated guesses if you don't know anything about the
issue.  (If you violate these basic rules, you will
look unprofessional, and we don't want you to give a bad impression.)  Bug
reports should be
<a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#reporting-bugs">complete</a>
and should usually be
<a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#reporting-bugs">reported</a>
to the issue tracker.
</p>


<h2 id="apply">How to apply</h2>

<p>
  To <b>apply</b>, you will submit a single PDF through the Google Summer
  of Code website.  This PDF should contain two main parts.  We suggest
  that you number the parts and subparts to ensure that you don't forget anything, and
  that we don't overlook anything in your application.  (You might find it
  easiest to create multiple PDFs for the different parts, then concatenate
  them before uploading to the website, but how you create your proposal is
  entirely up to you.)
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The proposal itself:  what project you want to work on during the
    summer.  You might propose to do a project listed on this webpage or a
    different project.

      <p>The proposal should have a descriptive title, both in the PDF and
      in the GSoC submission system.  Don't use a title like "Checker
      Proposal" or "Proposal for GSoC".
      Don't distract from content with gratuitous graphics.

    <p>If you want to create a new type system (whether one proposed on
    this webpage or one of your own devising), then your proposal should be
    its user manual.  You don't have to integrate it in the Checker
    Framework repository (in other words, use any word processor or text
    editor you want to create a PDF file you will submit), but you should describe
    your proposed checker's <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#creating-parts-of-a-checker">parts</a>
    in precise English or simple formalisms and you should follow the
    suggested <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#creating-documenting-a-checker">structure</a>.

    <p>We do not require a detailed timeline.  At this point, you don't
    know enough to create one.  The advantage of creating a timeline now
    would be that listing all the parts of the project might help you
    discover a part that you had forgotten.  Thinking about and listing the
    tasks, with an estimate of the time to perform each one, is a
    worthwhile activity.

    <p>Don't literally cut-and-paste text that was not written by you, because
    that would be plagiarism.  If you quote from text written by someone
    else, give proper credit.
    If you want to do exactly what is already
    listed on this page, then just say that (but be specific about which
      one!),
      and it will not hurt your
    chances of being selected.  However, you might have specific ideas
    about extensions, about details that are not mentioned on this webpage,
    about implementation strategies, and so forth.  If you want to do a
    case study, say what program you will do your case study on.

  </li>

  <li>Your qualifications.  Please convince us that you
    are likely to be successful in your proposed summer project.

    <ol>
      <li>A URL that points to a code sample.
        Don't write any new code, but provide code you wrote in the
        past, such as for a class assignment
        or a project you have worked on outside class.
        It does not need to have anything to do with
        the Checker Framework project.  It should be your own personal work.
        The purpose is to assess your programming skills so we can assign you
        to an appropriate project.
        A common problem is to submit undocumented code; we expect every
        programmer to write documentation when working on the Checker
        Framework.
        Don't put a lot of different files in Google Drive and share that
        URL; it's better to upload a single <code>.zip</code> file or
        provide a GitHub URL.
      </li>
      <li>
        What you have done to prepare yourself
        for working with the Checker Framework during the summer.
        You may wish to structure this as a list.
    Examples of items in the list include:
    <ul>
      <li>A URL for code you have annotated as a case study.  Please indicate the
    original unannotated code, the annotated code, and the exact command to
    run the type-checker from the command line.  Ensure that the GSoC
    mentors can compile your code.
    (It is acceptable to use the same code, or different code, for this
      item and the code sample above.)
      </li>
      <li>URLs for bugs or pull requests that you have filed.</li>
      <li>Information about other projects you have done, or classes you
        have taken, that prepare you for your proposed summer task.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A resume.</li>
  <li>An unofficial transcript or grade report (don't spend
    money for an official one).</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
The <b>best way</b> to impress us is by doing a thoughtful job in the case
study.
This may result in you submitting issues against the issue tracker of the
program you are annotating or of the Checker Framework.
Pull requests against our GitHub project are a plus but are not required:
good submitted bugs are just as valuable as bug fixes!
You can also make a good impression by correctly answering questions from
other students on the GSOC mailing list.
</p>

<p>
Get feedback!  Feel free to <a href="#ask-questions">ask questions</a>
to make your application more
competitive.  We want you to succeed, and historically, students who start
early and get feedback are most successful.  You can submit a draft
proposal via the Google Summer of Code website, and we will review it.  We
do <em>not</em> receive any notification when you submit a draft
proposal, so if you want feedback, please tell us that.
Also, we can only see draft proposals; we cannot see final proposals until
after the application deadline has passed.
</p>


<h1 id="case-studies">Case studies</h1>

<p>
These projects take an existing type-checker, apply it to a substantial
codebase (you can choose your favorite one, or you can ask for
suggestions), and determine whether the type system is easy to use and
whether it is effective in revealing or preventing defects.
Doing a case study is usually the first task that a new developer
performs when learning the Checker Framework (and a lot of
<a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#credits">people</a> have
contributed).
Case studies are our most important source of new ideas and improvements:
our most useful features have arisen as a result of an observation made
during a case study.  Many people have started out &ldquo;just&rdquo; doing a case
study but have ended up making deep, fundamental contributions.
</p>

<p>
Here are a few suggestions, but a case study of any type system
distributed with the Checker Framework is of value.
</p>


<h2 id="Case_study_of_preventing_index-out-of-bounds_errors">Preventing index-out-of-bounds errors</h2>

<p>
An index-out-of-bounds error occurs when a programmer provides an illegal
index to an array or list, as in <code>a[i]</code> or <code>a.get(i)</code>
where <code>i</code> is less than 0 or greater than the length of
<code>a</code>.  In languages like C, this is disastrous:  buffers
overflows lead to about 1/6 of all security vulnerabilities.  In languages
like Java, the result is &ldquo;merely&rdquo; that the program crashes.  In
both languages, it is desirable to prevent programmers from making this
error and to prevent users from suffering the bad consequences.
</p>

<p>
We have recently created a static analysis tool that prevents illegal index
array exceptions in Java programs.  We have not released it because we
don't yet know how effective this tool is.  Does it scale up to big,
interesting programs?  Are there common, important code patterns that it
fails to handle?  Does it produce too many false positive warnings?  Does
it place too heavy a burden on the user, either in terms of annotations or
in terms of complexity of the error messages?  Worst of all, are there
unknown unsoundnesses in the tool?
</p>

<p>
This project will be a substantial case study with the prototype index
analysis tool.  The first goal is to identify its merits and limitations.
The second goal is to improve it enough to make it usable by real-world
programmers.  A stretch goal is to extend it to handle collections such as
<code>List</code>s, where the <code>remove()</code> method makes sound,
precise analysis very tricky.
</p>

<p>
The tool, called the Index Checker, is not yet ready for distribution.
However, it is available in the current
Checker Framework release and in the Checker Framework's version control
repository, so you can already run it using the command-line argument
<code>-processor index</code>.  The Index Checker is not yet released,
so it does not have a chapter in the Checker Framework manual, but here is
a version of the manual that documents it:
<a href="index-checker-manual/manual.html">HTML</a>,
<a href="index-checker-manual/manual.pdf">PDF</a>.
Until it is released, we also use a different
<a href="https://github.com/kelloggm/checker-framework/issues">issue
  tracker</a> for bug reporting.
<!--
  If you have
cloned the
<a href="https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework.git"><code>checker-framework</code>
  repository</a>, but you can
reinstate the Index Checker manual chapter by changing
<a href="https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/blob/master/docs/manual/manual.tex#L44">line
  44</a> of file
<code>checker-framework/docs/manual/manual.tex</code> from
</p>
<pre>%\input{index-checker.tex}</pre>
<p>
to
</p>
<pre>\input{index-checker.tex}</pre>
<p>
and then running <code>make</code> in that directory (you don't have to
build the entire Checker Framework just to build its manual).
</p>
-->

<h2 id="Case_study_of_nullness_checking">Preventing null pointer exceptions</h2>

<!-- John Field of Google is interested in this. -->

<p>
This project is related to the
<a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> build system, and was
proposed by its development manager.
</p>

<p>
The Bazel codebase contains 1586 occurrences of the <code>@Nullable</code>
annotation.  This annotation indicates that a variable may hold a null
value.  This is valuable documentation and helps programmers avoid null
pointer exceptions that would crash Bazel.  However, these annotations are
not checked by any tool.  Instead, programmers have to do their best to
obey the <code>@Nullable</code> specifications in the source code.  This is
a lost opportunity, since documentation is most useful when it is
automatically processed and verified.  (For several years, Google tried
using <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/">FindBugs</a>, but they
eventually abandoned it:  its analysis is too weak, suffering too many
false positives and false negatives.)
</p>

<p>
Despite the programmers' best efforts, null pointer exceptions do still
creep into the code, impacting users.  The Bazel developers would like to
prevent these.  They want a guarantee, at compile time, that no null
pointer exceptions will occur at run time.
</p>

<p>
Such a tool already exists:  the
<a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#nullness-checker">Nullness
Checker</a> of the <a href="https://checkerframework.org/">Checker
Framework</a>.  It runs as a compiler plug-in, and it issues a warning at
every possible null pointer dereference.  If it issues no warnings, the
code is guaranteed not to throw a <code>NullPointerException</code> at run time.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this project is to do a large-scale case study of the Nullness
Checker on Bazel.  The main goal is to understand how the Nullness Checker
can be used on a large-scale industrial codebase.  How many lurking bugs
does it find?  What
<a href="https://checkerframework.org/releases/1.9.13/api/org/checkerframework/checker/nullness/qual/Nullable.html"><code>@Nullable</code></a>
annotations are missing from the codebase because the developers failed to
write them?  What are its limitations, such as code patterns that it cannot
recognize as safe?  (You might create new analyses and incorporating them
into the Nullness Checker, or you might just reporting bugs to the Nullness
Checker developers for fixing.)  What burdens does it place on users?  Is
the cost-benefit tradeoff worth the effort &mdash; that is, should Google
adopt this tool more broadly?  How should it be improved?  Are the most
needed improvements in the precision of the analysis, or in the UI of the
tooling?
</p>


<h2 id="sound-by-default">Sound checking by default</h2>

<p>
By default, the Checker Framework is
<a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#unsound-by-default">unsound
in several circumstances</a>.  &ldquo;Unsound&rdquo; means that the Checker Framework
may report no warning even though the program can misbehave at run time.
</p>

<p>
The reason that the Checker Framework is unsound is that we believe that
enabling these checks would cause too many false positive warnings:
warnings that the Checker Framework issues because it cannot prove that the
code is safe (even though a human can see that the code is safe).  Having
too many false positive warnings would irritate users and lead them not to
use the checker at all, or would force them to simply disable those checks.
</p>

<p>
We would like to do studies of these command-line options to see whether
our guess is right.  Is it prohibitive to enable sound checking?  Or can we
think of enhancements that would let us turn on those checks that are
currently disabled by default?
</p>


<h2 id="compare-other-tools">Comparison to other tools</h2>

<p>
  Many other tools exist for prevention of programming errors, such as
  FindBugs, JLint, PMD, and IDEs such as Eclipse and IntelliJ.  These tools
  are not as powerful as the Checker Framework (some are bug finders rather
  than verification tools, and some perform a shallower analysis), but they
  may be easier to use.
  Programmers who use these tools wonder, "Is it worth my time to switch to
  using the Checker Framework?"
</p>

<p>
  The goal of this project is to perform a head-to-head comparison of as
  many different tools as possible.  You will quantify:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of annotations that need to be written</li>
  <li>the number of bugs detected</li>
  <li>the number of bugs missed</li>
  <li>the number of false positive warnings</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This project will help programmers to choose among the different tools.
  This project will also indicate how each tool should be improved.
</p>


<h1 id="new-type-systems">New type systems</h1>

<p>
The Checker Framework is shipped with <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction">about 20 type-checkers</a>.  Users can
<a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#creating-a-checker">create a
  new checker</a> of their own.  However, some users don't want to go to
that trouble.  They would like to have more type-checkers packaged with the
Checker Framework for easy use.
</p>

<p>
Each of these projects requires you to design a <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#creating-a-checker">new type system</a>,
implement it, and perform case studies to demonstrate that it is both
usable and effective in finding/preventing bugs.
</p>


<h2 id="Erroneous_use_of_Java_8s_Optional_class">Erroneous use of Java 8's Optional class</h2>

<p>
Java 8 introduced the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html"><code>Optional</code></a>
class, a container that is either empty or contains a non-null value.  The
Web and blogosphere are full of incorrect claims that the
<code>Optional</code> class solves the problem of null pointer exceptions.
In fact, changing your code to use the <code>Optional</code> class
transforms a <code>NullPointerException</code> into a
<code>NoSuchElementException</code>, which still crashes your program, and
it creates new problems that were not a danger before.
</p>

<p>
You can learn more about the dangers of the <code>Optional</code> class in
the article
<a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mernst/advice/nothing-is-better-than-optional.html">Nothing
  is better than the <code>Optional</code> type</a>.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this project is to create a new tool that warns programmers who
have misused <code>Optional</code>.  It would enforce as many style rules
as possible for the <code>Optional</code> type, from among those listed in
Stuart Marks's summary of
<a href="https://stuartmarks.wordpress.com/2016/09/27/vjug24-session-on-optional/">
Optional: The Mother of All Bikesheds</a>.
</p>

<p>
The major problem is using <code>Optional.get()</code> when the
<code>Optional</code> might not be present.  This is exactly like the
problem of performing a field access on a value that might be null.
Therefore, it is likely that an existing solution can be directly adopted:
the logic of the
<a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#nullness-checker">Nullness
Checker</a> of the Checker Framework, or of some other nullness-checking
tool, can be adapted to the context of <code>Optional</code>.  Checking
correct use of <code>Optional</code> is much simpler than checking for null
pointer errors.
</p>

<p>
I suspect that the existence of such a tool would help to expose many
latent errors.  It might convince programmers that the <code>Optional</code> type isn't
that safe after all, but more importantly it would convince them to use it
in appropriate ways.

<h2 id="Make_programs_deterministic">Make programs deterministic</h2>

<!-- John Field of Google is interested in this. -->

<p>
Programs are easier to use and debug if their output is deterministic.  For
example, it is easier to test a deterministic program, because
nondeterminism can lead to flaky tests that sometimes succeed and sometimes
fail.  As another example, it is easier for a user or programmer to compare
two deterministic executions than two nondeterministic executions.
</p>

<p>
A number of Java methods return nondeterministic results, making any
program that uses them potentially nondeterministic.  Here are a few
examples:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>iteration over <code>HashMap</code>s and <code>HashSet</code>s</dt>
<dd>solution:  sort, or iterate over <code>LinkedHashMaps</code> and <code>LinkedHashSets</code></dd>
<dt><code>File.list()</code></dt>
<dd>solution:  sort the resulting list</dd>
<dt><code>Object.toString()</code>, <code>Object.hashCode()</code></dt>
<dd>solution:  use overriding implementations</dd>
<dt><code>new Random()</code></dt>
<dd>solution:  call it with a fixed seed</dd>
</dl>

<p>
You can find more examples of non-deterministic specifications,
and suggestions for how to avoid them, in the
<a href="https://randoop.github.io/randoop/manual/index.html#nondeterminism">Randoop
manual</a> and in the ICST 2016 paper
<a href="http://mir.cs.illinois.edu/marinov/publications/ShiETAL16NonDex.pdf">Detecting
assumptions on deterministic implementations of non-deterministic
specifications</a> by A. Shi, A. Gyori, O. Legunsen, and D. Marinov, which
presents the NonDex tool.
</p>

<p>
The NonDex tool works dynamically, which means that it cannot detect all
user-visible nondeterminism nor give a guarantee of correctness &mdash; a
guarantee that the the program is deterministic from the user's point of
view.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this project is to create a tool, based on a type system, that
gives a guarantee.  The tool would report to the user all possible
nondeterminism in a program, so that the user can fix the program before it
causes problems during testing or in the field.
</p>

<p>
More concretely, this problem can be handled by creating two simple type
systems that indicate whether a given value is deterministic.
In each diagram, the supertype appears above the subtype.
</p>

<pre>
    @PossiblyNonDeterministic            @PossiblyNonDeterministicOrder
              |                                       |
        @Deterministic                       @DeterministicOrder
</pre>

<p>
The programmer would annotate routines that are expected to take
deterministic inputs.  (An example could be all printing routines.)  Then,
the type system would issue a warning whenever one of those routines is
called on a possibly non-deterministic value.
</p>

<p>
The standard library would have annotations for
</p>
<ul>
  <li>methods that return non-deterministic results</li>
  <li>methods like sort that convert nondeterministically-ordered collections into deterministically-ordered ones</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="Bounded-size_strings">Bounded-size strings</h2>

<!-- John Field of Google is interested in this. -->

<p>
Windows cannot run command lines longer than 8191 characters.  Creating a
too-long command line causes failures when the program is run on Windows.
These failures are irritating when discovered during testing, and
embarrassing or worse when discovered during deployment.  The same command
line would work on Unix, which has longer command-line limits, and as a
result developers may not realize that their change to a command can cause
such a problem.
</p>

<p>
Programmers would like to enforce that they don't accidentally pass a
too-long string to the <code>exec()</code> routine.  The goal of this
project is to give a compile-time tool that provides such a guarantee.
</p>

<p>
Here are two possible solutions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Simple solution:</b>
For each array and list, determine whether its length is known at compile
time.  The routines that build a command line are only allowed to take such
constant-length lists, on the assumption that if the length is constant,
its concatenation is probably short enough.
</p>

<p>
<b>More complex solution:</b>
For each String, have a compile-time estimate of its maximum length.  Only
permit <code>exec()</code> to be called on strings whose estimate is no more than 8191.
String concatenation would return a string whose estimated size is the sum
of the maximums of its arguments, and likewise for concatenating an array
or list of strings.
</p>

<h2 id="Avoiding_exponential_blowup_when_processing_DAGs">Avoiding exponential blowup when processing DAGs</h2>

<!-- John Field of Google is interested in this. -->

<p>
Google's <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> open-source project is a
publicly-released version of their build system, Blaze.  Blaze builds every
line of source code that is written by any Google programmer &mdash; all of
that source code appears in a single repository!  Therefore, Bazel/Blaze needs to
be fast.  Bazel represents all of the source code and its dependencies as a
large DAG (a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed
acyclic graph</a>).  It needs to manipulate these DAGs efficiently.
</p>

<p>
One of the biggest problems that the Bazel developers face is exponential
blowup of DAG sizes and therefore of run time.  Periodically, one of the
Bazel developers makes such a mistake, and Bazel becomes unusable until
they can diagnose and fix the problem.
</p>

<p>
Here are two different ways to view the problem.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    In a DAG, multiple nodes may have the same child.  Traversing the DAG
    naively would visit the child multiple times &mdash; in the worst case,
    exponentially many times.  It is necessary to avoid doing so.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bazel contains a function that takes a DAG as input and generates a DAG
    as output (the output is an object graph).  The Bazel developers want to
    ensure that the size of the output DAG is O(|input DAG|). The input DAG is
    processed bottom-up (it ensures that each input node is visited once) and
    Bazel stores the results of intermediate computations that construct the
    output DAG with nodes of the input DAG. The key thing the Bazel developers
    want to avoid is copying intermediate subgraphs that have unbounded size.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
More concretely, there is only one Java type for all DAGs, and there is a
method <code>flatten()</code>.  It's a mistake to call
<code>flatten()</code> on certain DAGs, because doing so may cause
exponential blowup.
</p>

<!--
</p>

<p>
A pluggable type system can subdivide the Java type, using this type hierarchy:
</p>

<p>
  @PossbilyPropagatable
          |
  @NotPropagatable
</p>

<p>
A call to flatten() is permitted only if the receiver is known to be
@NotPropagatable.
</p>

<p>
This should be very easy to code up and evaluate, once we have more precise
definitions.
-->

<p>
The goal of this project would be to better understand the problem with
Bazel, to formalize it, and to create a program analysis that solves
the problem.  You would evaluate your work by running it on the Bazel
codebase to discover latent problems, or by providing it to the Bazel
developers to run each time they propose a code change.  The Bazel
team is interested in collaborating by evaluating a tool.
</p>


<h2 id="nullness-bug-detector">Nullness bug detector</h2>

<p>
Verifying a program to be free of errors can be a daunting task.  When
starting out, a user may be more interested in
<a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#other-tools">bug-finding</a>
than verification.  The goal of this project is to create a nullness bug
detector that uses the powerful analysis of the Checker Framework and its
Nullness Checker, but omits some of its more confusing or expensive
features.  The goal is to create a fast, easy-to-use bug detector.  It
would enable users to start small and advance to full verification in the
future, rather than having to start out doing full verification.
</p>

<p>
This could be structured as a new NullnessLight Checker, or as a
command-line argument to the current Nullness Checker.  Here are some
differences from the real Nullness checker:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>No initialization analysis; the checker assumes that every value is
  initialized.</li>
  <li>No map key analysis; assume that, at every call to
    <code>Map.get</code>, the given key appears in the map.</li>
  <li>No invalidation of dataflow facts.  Assume all method calls are pure,
  so method calls do not invalidate dataflow facts.  Assume there is no
    aliasing, so field updates do not invalidate dataflow facts.
    </li>
  <li>Assume that boxing of primitives is <code>@Pure</code>: it returns
  the same value on every call.</li>
  <li>If the Checker Framework cannot infer a type argument, assume that
  the type argument is <code>@NonNull</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each of these behaviors should be controlled by its own command-line
  argument, as well as being enabled in the NullnessLight Checker.
</p>

<p>
  The implementation may be relatively straightforward, since in most cases
  the behavior is just to disable some functionality of existing checkers.
</p>

<p>It will be interesting to compare this NullnessLight Checker to the
  regular Nullness Checker:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>How much easier is it to use?  For example, how many fewer
      annotations need to be written?</li>
    <li>
      How many more fewer true positives does it report &mdash; in other
      words, how many more false negatives does it suffer?
    </li>
    <li>
      How many fewer false positives does it report?
    </li>
  </ul>



<h2 id="typestate">Stateful type systems</h2>

<p>
This project is to improve support for
<a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#typestate-checker">typestate checking</a>
</p>

<p>
Ordinarily, a program variable has
the same type throughout its lifetime from when the variable is declared
until it goes out of scope. “Typestate”
permits the type of an object or variable to <em>change</em> in a controlled way.
Essentially, it is a combination of standard type systems with dataflow
analysis. For instance, a file object changes from unopened, to opened, to
closed; certain operations such as writing to the file are only permitted
when the file is in the opened typestate. Another way of saying this is
that <code>write</code> is permitted after <code>open</code>, but not after <code>close</code>.
Typestate
is applicable to many other types of software properties as well.
</p>

<p>
Two <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/">typestate checking frameworks</a>
exist for the Checker Framework.  Neither is being maintained; a new one
needs to be written.
</p>


<h2 id="your-own-new-type-system">Invent your own new type system</h2>

<p>
We also welcome your ideas for new type systems.  For example, any run-time
failure can probably be prevented at compile time with the right
analysis.  Can you come up with a way to fix your pet peeve?
</p>

<p>
It is easiest, but not required, to choose an existing type system from the
literature, since that means you can skip the design stage and go right to
implementation.
</p>

<p>
This task can be simple or very
challenging, depending on how ambitious the type system is.  Remember to
focus on what helps a software developer most!
</p>



<h1 id="other">Other enhancements and tools</h1>


<h2 id="javaparser">Upgrade to a newer version of JavaParser</h2>

<p>
<a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#stub">Stub files</a> are a
way to express the specification of a library.  The stub parser is a tool
that reads stub files.  These stub files may be Java files, or may omit
method bodies for brevity.  The stub parser is a slightly modified version
of the JavaParser tool &mdash; it can handle missing method bodies and
other omissions.  The stub parser was created by modifying and extending
the current version of JavaParser, but that was several years ago, so
Stubparser is missing a number of Java 6, 7, and 8 features.
</p>

<p>
The goal of the project is to create a new version of the stub parser that
is based on the latest JavaParser tool.  This could be done by either
upgrading the current stub parser (replacing its old JavaParser classes by
new ones), or by starting over.  In either case, you can use the old stub
parser for regression testing.  This project is important because users
have found the current stub parser's syntactic limitations irritating.
This project would have a big impact, since it would close six different
issues in the issue tracker:
<a href="https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/issues/571">#571</a>
and 5 others that it refers to.
</p>


<h2 id="asm">Upgrade to a newer version of ASM</h2>

<p>
  The
  <a href="https://checkerframework.org/annotation-file-utilities/">Annotation
  File Utilities</a>, or AFU, insert annotations into, and extract
  annotations from, <code>.java</code> files, <code>.class</code> files,
  and text files.  These programs were written before the
  <a href="http://asm.ow2.org/">ASM</a> bytecode library supported Java 8's
  type annotations.  Therefore, the AFU has its own custom version of ASM
  that supports type annotations.  Now that ASM 5 has been released and it
  supports type annotations, the AFU needs to be slightly changed to use
  the official ASM 5 library instead of its own custom ASM variant.
</p>

<p>
  This project is a good way to learn about <code>.class</code> files and
  Java bytecodes:  how they are stored, and how to manipulate them.
</p>


<h2 id="analysis_diffs">Tool for analysis diffs</h2>

<p>
   Many program analyses are too verbose to
   expect a person to read their entire output.  However, after a program
   change (whether a refactoring, a bug fix, an enhancement, or addition of
   new code), the difference is likely to be small between the analysis run on the old code and
   the analysis run on the new code.  Showing
   this to a developer may be useful, and in particular can help the
   programmer to better understand the changes he or she has made.
</p>

<p>
   Two varieties of analyses to which this could be applied are bug
   detection tools (whose output is otherwise far too verbose) and
   inference tools.
   <a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/">FindBugs</a>
   is a bug detection tool that produces far too much output to
   make it reasonable to use on substantial existing projects.
   <a href="https://plse.cs.washington.edu/daikon/download/doc/daikon.html#DynComp-for-Java">DynComp</a> is an inference tool whose
   output could become manageable to users if they were shown it in small
   doses.  There are many other examples.
</p>

<p>
   This is probably a simple tool to write.  (Or maybe it already exists:
   something of this sort appears to be built into FindBugs, but it would
   be nice to generalize that so as to be able to wrap any analysis.)
</p>

<!--
  An application:  checklink, where I want only two consecutive failures to
  be reported.  Or, build that into checklink itself?
  Another application: pluggable type-checkers, or type inference, where
  only changes are relevant.
-->


<h2 id="performance">Performance improvements</h2>

<p>
  The Checker Framework runs much slower than the standard javac compiler
  &mdash; often 20 times slower!  This is not acceptable as part of a
  developer's regular process, so we need to speed up the Checker
  Framework.  This project involves determining the cause of slowness in
  the Checker Framework, and correcting those problems.
</p>

<p>
This is a good way to learn about performance tuning for Java applications.
</p>

<p>
  Some concrete tasks include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Profile the Checker Framework.  Run a profiler such as
  <a href="https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/">YourKit</a> to determine
  which parts of the Checker Framework consume the most CPU time.
  </li>

  <li>Perhaps compare a profile of the Checker Framework against a profile
  of regular javac.  This probably is not necessary because the Checker
    Framework is so much slower than regular javac.
  </li>

  <li>Consider interning string values.  The Checker Framework does a fair
  amount of string manipulation, in part because it reads from resources
  such as stub files that do not produce <code>Element</code>s.  Interning
  could save time when doing comparisons.  You can verify the correctness
  of the optimization by running the
  <a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#interning-checker">Interning
    Checker</a> on the Checker Framework code.  Compare the run time of the
  Checker Framework before and after this optimization.
  </li>

  <li> Based on profiling results, devise other optimizations, implement
    them, and evaluate them.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="Whole-program_type_inference">Whole-program type inference</h2>

<p>
A type system is useful because it prevents certain errors.  The downside
of a type system is the effort required to write the types.  Type inference
is the process of writing the types for a program.
</p>

<p>
Type-<em>checking</em> is a modular, or local, analysis.  For example, given a
procedure in which types have been written, a type-checker can verify the
procedure's types without examining the implementation of any other
procedure.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, type <em>inference</em> is a non-local, whole-program analysis.  For
example, to determine what type should be written for a procedure's formal
parameter, it is necessary to examine the type of the argument at every
call to that procedure.  At every call, to determine the type of some argument A, it
may be necessary to know the types of the formal parameters to the
procedure that contains A, and so forth.  It is possible to resolve this
seemingly-infinite regress, but only by examining the entire program in the
worst case.
</p>

<p>
The differences between type checking and type inference means that they
are usually written in very different ways.  Type inference is usually done
by first collecting all of the constraints for the entire program, then
passing them to a specialized solver.  Writing a type inference tool is
harder.  Worst of all, it's annoying to encode all the type rules twice in
different ways:  once for the type checker and once for the type inference.
</p>

<p>
As a result, many type systems have a type checker but no type inference
tool.  This makes programmers reluctant to use these type systems, which denies
programmers the benefits of type-checking.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this project is to automatically create type inference tools
from type-checking tools, so that it is not necessary for the type system
designer to implement the type system twice in different ways.
</p>

<p>
A key insight is that the type-checker already encodes all knowledge about
what is a legal, well-typed program.  How can we exploit that for the
purpose of type inference as well as type-checking?  The idea is to
iteratively run the type-checker, multiple times, observing what types are
passed around the program and what errors occur.  Each iteration collects
more information, until there is nothing more to learn.
</p>

<p>
This approach has some disadvantages:  it is theoretically slower, and
theoretically less accurate, than a purpose-built type inference tool for
each type system.  However, it has the major advantage that it requires no
extra work to implement a type inference tool.  Furthermore, maybe it works
well enough in practice.
</p>

<p>
A prototype implementation of this idea already exists, but it needs to be
evaluated in order to discover its flaws, improve its design, and discover
how accurate it is in practice.
</p>


<h2 id="Purity_analysis">Purity (side effect) analysis</h2>

<p>
A program analysis technique makes estimates about the current values of
expressions.  When a method call occurs, the analysis has to throw away
most of its estimates, because the method call might change any variable.
If the method is known to have no side effects, then the analysis doesn't
need to throw away its estimates, and the analysis is more precise.
</p>

<p>
For example, the Checker Framework unsoundly trusts but does not check
<a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#type-refinement-purity">purity annotations</a>.  This makes
the system vulnerable to programmer mistakes when writing annotations.  The
Checker Framework contains a sound checker for immutability annotations,
but it suffers too many false positive warnings and thus is not usable.  A
better checker is necessary.  It will also incorporate aspects of an escape
analysis.
</p>

<p>
Choosing an algorithm from the literature is the best choice, but there
still might be research work to do:  in the past, when implementing
algorithms from research papers, we have sometimes found that they did not
work as well as claimed, and we have had to enhance them.  One challenge is
that any technique used by pluggable type-checking to verify immutability
must be modular, but many side effect analyses require examining the whole
program.  The system should require few or no method annotations within
method bodies.  I'm not sure whether such a system already exists or we
need to design a new one.
</p>

<!-- For design and implementation ideas, see $qn/notes-purity. -->


<h2 id="javadoc">Javadoc support</h2>

<p>
Currently, type annotations are only displayed in Javadoc if they are
explicitly written by the programmer.  However, the Checker Framework
provides flexible defaulting mechanisms, reducing the annotation overhead.
This project will integrate the Checker Framework defaulting phase with
Javadoc, showing the signatures after applying defaulting rules.
</p>

<p>
There are other type-annotation-related improvements to Javadoc that can be
explored, e.g. using JavaScript to show or hide only the type annotations
currently of interest.
</p>


<h2 id="run-time-checking">Run-time checking</h2>

<p>
Implement run-time checking to complement compile-time checking.  This will
let users combine the power of static checking with that of dynamic
checking.
</p>

<p>
Every type system is too strict: it rejects some programs that never go
wrong at run time. A human must insert a type loophole to make such a
program type-check.  For example, Java takes this approach with its
cast operation (and in some other places).
</p>

<p>
When doing type-checking, it is desirable to automatically insert run-time
checks at each operation that the static checker was unable to verify.
(Again, Java takes exactly this approach.)  This guards against mistakes by
the human who inserted the type loopholes.  A nice property of this
approach is that it enables you to prevent errors in a program
with no type annotations:  whenever the static checker is unable
to verify an operation, it would insert a dynamic check.  Run-time checking
would also be useful in verifying whether the suppressed warnings are
correct &mdash; whether the programmer made a mistake when writing them.
</p>

<p>
The annotation processor (the pluggable type-checker) should automatically
insert the checks, as part of the compilation process.
</p>

<p>
There should be various modes for the run-time checks:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>fail immediately.</li>
  <li>logging, to permit post-mortem debugging without crashing the program.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The run-time penalty should be small:  a run-time check is necessary only
at the location of each cast or suppressed warning.  Everywhere that the
compile-time checker reports no possible error, there is no need to insert a
check.  But, it will be an interesting project to determine how to minimize
the run-time cost.
</p>

<p>
Another interesting, and more challenging, design question is whether you need to add and maintain
a run-time representation of the property being tested.  It's easy to test
whether a particular value is null, but how do you test whether it is
tainted, or should be treated as immutable?  For a more concrete example,
see the discussion of the (not yet implemented)
[Javari run-time checker](http://pag.csail.mit.edu/pubs/ref-immutability-oopsla2005-abstract.html).
Adding this run-time support would be an interesting and challenging project.
</p>

<p>
We developed a prototype for the
<a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~wdietl/publications/pubs/EnerJ11-abstract.html">EnerJ runtime system</a>.
That code could be used as starting point, or you could start afresh.
</p>

<p>
In the short term, this could be prototyped as a source- or
bytecode-rewriting approach; but integrating it into the type checker is a
better long-term implementation strategy.
</p>



<h2 id="ide-support">IDE support</h2>

<p>
The Checker Framework comes with support for
<a href="https://checkerframework.org/manual/#external-tools">external tools</a>,
including an Eclipse plug-in.
</p>

<p>
  These plug-ins and other integration should be improved.
  We have a number of concrete ideas, but you will also probably come up
  with some after a few minutes of using the existing IDE plugins!
</p>

<p>
  This is only a task for someone who is already an expert, such as someone
  who has built IDE plugins before.
  The reason is that we don't want to be stuck maintaining code written by
  someone who is just learning how to write an IDE plugin.
</p>

<!--
Integrate the Checker Framework with an IDE such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, IDEA or NetBeans,
which will make pluggable type-checking easier to use and more attractive to developers.

Some specific projects include:
  * Create an IDE plug-in that invokes the checker and reports any errors to the developer, just as the IDE currently does for type errors.
  * Improve the existing Eclipse plug-in.
  * Add a button to the IDE that hides/shows all annotations of a given variety, to reduce clutter.  This would be useful beyond type annotations.
  * Implement quick fixes for common errors.
  * Integrate type inference with the IDE, to make it easier for a developer to add annotations to code.
  * Improve an IDE's existing refactoring support so that it is aware of, and properly retains, type annotations.
  * Highlight defaulted types and flow-sensitive type refinements, making error messages easier to understand.
  * Highlight the parts of the code that influenced flow-sensitive type refinements, again to make errors easier to comprehend.

IDEs that build on the OpenJDK Java compiler could benefit from even tighter integration with the Checker Framework.

This project may entail the following:

  * familiarity with the IDE plug-in development environment, Eclipse PDT or NetBeans plug-in support:  By the end of the project, the developer should be familiar with building reasonably complex IDE plug-ins.

  * UI/UX design:  The developer would design a UI experience that is appealing to developers and integrates well with the developer's workflow!
-->


<h2 id="exhaustive-testing">Model checking of a type system</h2>

<p>
Design and implement an algorithm to check type soundness of a type system
by exhaustively verifying the type checker on all programs up to a certain
size. The challenge lies in efficient enumeration of all programs and
avoiding redundant checks, and in knowing the expected outcome of the
tests.  This approach is related to bounded exhaustive
testing and model checking; for a reference, see
[Efficient Software Model Checking of Soundness of Type Systems](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~bchandra/publications/oopsla08.pdf).
